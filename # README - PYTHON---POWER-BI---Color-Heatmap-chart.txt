create a PYTHON script for POWER BI that creates a COLOR HEATMAP chart based on a dataset
ChatGPT
Sure! Below is a Python script that generates a COLOR HEATMAP chart based on a dataset using the Plotly library. Plotly is a powerful library for creating interactive visualizations in Python. This script will create a simple color heatmap chart using Plotly and then export it as an HTML file, which can be easily embedded into Power BI.

python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import plotly.offline as pyo
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Category': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'],
    'Value': [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Pivot the data for heatmap
heatmap_data = df.pivot_table(index='Category', aggfunc='mean')

# Create heatmap trace
heatmap_trace = go.Heatmap(
    z=[heatmap_data['Value']],
    x=heatmap_data.columns,
    y=heatmap_data.index,
    colorscale='Viridis'  # You can change the color scale as needed
)

# Define layout
layout = go.Layout(
    title='Color Heatmap Chart',
    xaxis=dict(title='X-axis'),
    yaxis=dict(title='Y-axis')
)

# Create figure
fig = go.Figure(data=[heatmap_trace], layout=layout)

# Save the figure as HTML file
pyo.plot(fig, filename='color_heatmap.html')
This script first creates a sample dataset, then pivots the data to prepare it for the heatmap chart. It then creates a heatmap trace using Plotly's Heatmap object, specifying the data, colorscale, and other parameters. Finally, it creates a layout for the chart and combines the trace and layout into a Plotly figure. The figure is saved as an HTML file using Plotly's plot function.

You can embed the generated HTML file into Power BI as a web content or use it directly in your reports.
